In here you'll find the actual website code. The site is written in Astro and TypeScript and is based on [Spectre](https://github.com/louisescher/spectre), a public theme I created while making this site. If you want to create a site based on mine, I recommend using Spectre instead of forking this entire repository.

If you have any questions about the site itself, check out Spectre. The READMEs and blog post on the showcase site explain how everything works pretty well.
