Ion is a Starlight theme that seeks to provide a modern look while maintaining all features and adding new ones.

## Why

Ion was originally intended to be a private theme for a project I was creating. However, I got side-tracked with customizing Starlight and ended up making the documentation into a theme. The original intent was to update Starlight's colors and navigation bar, as I feel like those are it's greatest weaknesses. 

## Features

In addition to the default features of Starlight, Ion includes:

- A new color scheme
- A Footer component
- Icons in the sidebar
- Header badges
- An overhauled navigation bar with auto-collapsing items

A quick site note, I recently found out that this theme is apparently popular enough to be shown on [astro.build](https://astro.build) in the themes section as a documentation theme. Thanks to whoever added it there!
