@SCII (pronounced at-scii) is a filter for the popular three.js graphics library. It turns the whole scene into an ASCII-version when applied!

## Why

Towards the end of 2023 I got really into ASCII art and 3D rendering with three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics. After experimenting around with both of them, I noticed that the default ASCII effect included in three.js was not only a bit lackluster but also quite slow. This led me to create my own ASCII filter for three.js, which I named @SCII.

## Features

- Much quicker than the default ASCII effect in three.js
- Customizable character set
- Customizable resolution & scale
- Customizable color palette
