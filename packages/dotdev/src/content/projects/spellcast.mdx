Spellcast is a cross-platform podcast app that allows you to relive the magic of podcasts.

## Why

It's honestly pretty simple - When Google Podcasts got shut down in 2024, I got pretty annoyed. I liked that app! It was easy to use and allowed me to separate my podcasts from my music. I don't know why I do that, but I've come to expect it.

I also listen to podcasts on my PC, but I didn't like the alternatives I was seeing. So I just decided to make my own.

## How
I wanted to challenge myself to create something using only [Astro](https://docs.astro.build), so I decided to go with a PWA. While often frowned upon, I believe that a PWA can provide a close-to-native experience for the user with enough polish while still making sure that I don't have to maintain multiple codebases at once.
